### How to run? 

##### Option 1 ( _Python_ )
In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have **Python 2.x**, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don’t have Python installed, navigate to Python’s website to download and install the software.

With your server running, visit the site: __http://localhost:8000__
##### Option 2 ( _VSCode_ )
Install extension Live Server in your VSCode editor using Extensions (**__Ctrl+Shift+X__**). Reload editor. Open your project, find icon **_Go Live_** and click it. Browser should open your page, but if not open __localhost:5500__ in your browser.
